Drawing on powerful, modern tools from convex optimization, this rigorous exposition introduces essential techniques for formulating linear, second-order cone, and semidefinite programming approximations to the canonical optimal power flow problem, which lies at the heart of many different power system optimizations. Convex models in each optimization class are then developed in parallel for a variety of practical applications like unit commitment, generation and transmission planning, and nodal pricing. Presenting classical approximations and modern convex relaxations side-by-side, and a selection of problems and worked examples, this is an invaluable resource for students and researchers from industry and academia in power systems, optimization, and control"},

	abstract = {Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) are an essential component of the nascent decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) ecosystem. The most common DEXes are so-called automated market makers (AMMs), smart contracts that pool liquidity and process trades as atomic swaps of tokens. AMMs price transactions with a deterministic liquidity invariance rule that only uses the AMM’s token deposits as inputs and that has no precedent in traditional ﬁnance. Yet in the context of transparent and open blockchain operations, any liquidity invariance pricing function allows so-called sandwich attacks (akin to frontrunning) that increase the cost of trading and threaten the long-term viability of the DeFi eco-system. Linear price rules that commonly emerge in economic models have similar problems, except for uniform pricing for which sandwich attack proﬁts are limited and smaller, but which invites excessive order splitting.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of blockchain technology and their numerous emerging applications has received huge attention in recent years. The distributed consensus mechanism is the backbone of a blockchain network. It plays a key role in ensuring the network’s security, integrity, and performance. Most current blockchain networks have been deploying the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, in which the consensus is reached through intensive mining processes. However, this mechanism has several limitations, e.g., energy inefﬁciency, delay, and vulnerable to security threats. To overcome these problems, a new consensus mechanism has been developed recently, namely proof of stake, which enables to achieve the consensus via proving the stake ownership. This mechanism is expected to become a cutting-edge technology for future blockchain networks. This paper is dedicated to investigating proof-of-stake mechanisms, from fundamental knowledge to advanced proof-of-stake-based protocols along with performance analysis, e.g., energy consumption, delay, and security, as well as their promising applications, particularly in the ﬁeld of Internet of Vehicles. The formation of stake pools and their effects on the network stake distribution are also analyzed and simulated. The results show that the ratio between the block reward and the total network stake has a signiﬁcant impact on the decentralization of the network. Technical challenges and potential solutions are also discussed.},

This technology has several key characteristics, including decentralization, time-stamped data, consensus mechanism, traceability, programmability, security, and credibility, and block data is essentially tamper-proof. Due to these characteristics, blockchain can address the shortcomings of traditional ﬁnancial institutions. As a result, this emerging technology has garnered signiﬁcant attention from ﬁnancial intermediaries, technology-based companies, and government agencies. This article offers an overview of the fundamentals of blockchain technology and its various applications. The introduction deﬁnes blockchain and explains its fundamental working principles, emphasizing features such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency. The article then traces the evolution of blockchain, from its inception in cryptocurrency to its development as a versatile tool with diverse potential applications. The main body of the article explores fundamentals of block chain systems, its limitations, various applications, applicability etc. Finally, the study concludes by discussing the present state of blockchain technology and its future potential, as well as the challenges that must be surmounted to unlock its full potential.},

The field demonstration took place in Washington and Oregon and was paid for by the U.S. Department of Energy and several northwest utilities. Price is found to be an effective control signal for managing transmission or distribution congestion. Real-time signals at 5-minute intervals are shown to shift controlled load in time. The behaviors of customers and their responses under fixed, time-of-use, and real-time price contracts are compared. Peak loads are effectively reduced on the experimental feeder. A novel application of portfolio theory is applied to the selection of an optimal mix of customer contract types.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a P2P energy trading system over Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with AMM (Automated Market Maker) for innovatory speed improvement. Participants in the network will adequately use tokens for trading: energy coin, money coin, whereas tokens are cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for the real value. Unlike the existing network, which required certain conditions for transactions to be established, The proposed network matches transactions instantaneously with minimal process. Adapting the AMM, trades are established on the P2P energy trading system without any additional factors since market prices are determined whenever tokens are inserted into the liquidity pool. By providing an optimized trading environment, we expect further development of the P2P energy trading industry.},

	abstract = {The hybrid-energy storage systems (ESSs) are promising eco-friendly power converter devices used in a wide range of applications. However, their insufﬁcient lifespan is one of the key issues by hindering their large-scale commercial application. In order to extend the lifespan of the hybrid-ESSs, the cost functions proposed in this paper include the degradation of the hydrogen devices and the battery. Indeed, this paper aims to develop a sophisticated model predictive control strategy for a grid-connected wind and solar microgrid, which includes a hydrogen-ESS, a battery-ESS, and the interaction with external consumers, e.g., battery/fuel cell electric vehicles. The integrated system requires the management of its energy production in different forms, i.e., the electric and the hydrogen ones. The proposed strategy consists of the economical and operating costs of the hybrid-ESSs, the degradation issues, and the physical and dynamic constraints of the system. The mixed-logic dynamic framework is required to model the operating modes of the hybrid-ESSs and the switches between them. The effectiveness of the controller is analyzed by numerical simulations which are conducted using solar and wind generation proﬁles of solar panels and wind farms located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Such simulations, indeed, show that the proposed strategy appropriately manages the plant by fulﬁlling constraints and energy requests while reducing device costs and increasing battery life.},

	abstract = {Physical analogs have shown considerable promise for understanding the behavior of complex adaptive systems, including macroeconomics, biological systems, social networks, and electric power markets. Many of today’s most challenging technical and policy questions can be reduced to a distributed economic control problem. Indeed, economically based control of large-scale systems is founded on the conjecture that the price-based regulation (e.g., auctions, markets) results in an optimal allocation of resources and emergent optimal system control. This report explores the state-of-the-art physical analogs for understanding the behavior of some econophysical systems and deriving stable and robust control strategies for using them. We review and discuss applications of some analytic methods based on a thermodynamic metaphor, according to which the interplay between system entropy and conservation laws gives rise to intuitive and governing global properties of complex systems that cannot be otherwise understood. We apply these methods to the question of how power markets can be expected to behave under a variety of conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper develops and assesses the performance of a short-term demand response (DR) model for utility load control with applications to resource planning and control design. Long term response models tend to underestimate short-term demand response when induced by prices. This has two important consequences. First, planning studies tend to undervalue DR and often overlook its beneﬁts in utility demand management program development. Second, when DR is not overlooked, the open-loop DR control gain estimate may be too low. This can result in overuse of load resources, control instability and excessive price volatility. Our objective is therefore to develop a more accurate and better performing shortterm demand response model. We construct the model from ﬁrst principles about the nature of thermostatic load control and show that the resulting formulation corresponds exactly to the Random Utility Model employed in economics to study consumer choice. The model is tested against empirical data collected from ﬁeld demonstration projects and is shown to perform better than alternative models commonly used to forecast demand in normal operating conditions. The results suggest that (1) existing utility tariffs appear to be inadequate to incentivize demand response, particularly in the presence of high renewables, and (2) existing load control systems run the risk of becoming unstable if utilities close the loop on real-time prices.},

	abstract = {Demand response is a crucial aspect of the future smart grid. It has the potential to provide signiﬁcant peak demand reduction and to ease the incorporation of renewable energy into the grid. Data centers’ participation in demand response is becoming increasingly important given their high and increasing energy consumption and their ﬂexibility in demand management compared to conventional industrial facilities. In this paper, we study two demand response schemes to reduce a data center’s peak loads and energy expenditure: workload shifting and the use of local power generation. We conduct a detailed characterization study of coincident peak data over two decades from Fort Collins Utilities, Colorado and then develop two algorithms for data centers by combining workload scheduling and local power generation to avoid the coincident peak and reduce the energy expenditure. The ﬁrst algorithm optimizes the expected cost and the second one provides a good worst-case guarantee for any coincident peak pattern, workload demand and renewable generation prediction error distributions. We evaluate these algorithms via numerical simulations based on real world traces from production systems. The results show that using workload shifting in combination with local generation can provide signiﬁcant cost savings (up to 40\% under the Fort Collins Utilities charging scheme) compared to either alone.},

	abstract = {I examine developments in the application of performance-based regulation (PBR) to electricity distribution and transmission in the United States. Applications of comprehensive PBR to electricity distribution had been slow to diffuse in the United States prior to roughly 2000. PBR mechanisms are now being applied more frequently to electricity distribution, reflecting the changing structure of the electric power industry and the increasing obligations being placed on electric distribution companies. The new obligations are a consequence primarily of aggressive targets for decarbonizing the electricity sector in nearly half the states and the goal of using “clean” electricity to electrify transportation, buildings, and other sectors. PBR should be viewed as a set of “building blocks” that can be adopted in various combinations and should recognize that PBR and traditional cost of service regulation (COSR) are properly viewed as complements rather than substitutes. Recent reforms in the regulation of distribution companies in Great Britain, called RIIO, have been influential in the U.S. The main reforms contained in RIIO are discussed. There has been essentially no application of PBR by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to owners of transmission assets or to independent transmission operators. FERC has applied targeted incentives to encourage investment in transmission facilities and membership in independent system operator organizations. However, the regulation of transmission rates relies primarily on COSR in the form of formula rates and has poor incentive properties. Regulation of independent system operators is a challenge because they are non-profit organizations. Reforms here are suggested.},

          , 
            
              Data centers represent the information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world. Demand for their services has been rising rapidly (
              1
              ), and data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand further (
              2
              ). Given that data centers are energy-intensive enterprises, estimated to account for around 1\% of worldwide electricity use, these trends have clear implications for global energy demand and must be analyzed rigorously. Several oft-cited yet simplistic analyses claim that the energy used by the world's data centers has doubled over the past decade and that their energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade (
              3
              –
              5
              ). Such estimates contribute to a conventional wisdom (
              5
              ,
              6
              ) that as demand for data center services rises rapidly, so too must their global energy use. But such extrapolations based on recent service demand growth indicators overlook strong countervailing energy efficiency trends that have occurred in parallel (see the first figure). Here, we integrate new data from different sources that have emerged recently and suggest more modest growth in global data center energy use (see the second figure). This provides policy-makers and energy analysts a recalibrated understanding of global data center energy use, its drivers, and near-term efficiency potential.},

We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues—ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: consonant, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and dissonant, to colleagues from different network communities. We hypothesize that consonant exposure engenders more group solidarity, more persistent relationships, and enhanced social belonging. We test these expectations in a pre-registered field experiment at a non-profit organization. Participants (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development experience with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either consonant or dissonant groups. Although the anticipated solidarity advantage of consonant exposure was only marginally significant when assessed immediately following the intervention, consonant-condition participants maintained more intervention-group ties and reported greater social belonging three months after the intervention. Yet, pointing to the potential tradeoffs of consonant versus dissonant exposure, dissonant-condition participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.},

A hierarchical framework is first proposed for the energy demand side management through peer-to-peer exchange of energy information in the real-time market. The heterogeneity of demand flexibility associated with different types of users is reflected in the framework with inter-sectorial interactions modelled by a non-cooperative game. The inherent uncertainty of renewable generation is also considered with the technique of receding horizon optimization. Subsequently, smart contracts and decentralized identifier guaranteed by blockchain technologies are implemented to create a seamless, secured and efficient distributed energy system. Finally, a Singapore-based case study is conducted and the results show that with effective interactions among participants, electricity consumption of the entire energy system closely tracks the generation pattern of renewable resources, resulting in a significantly flattened schedule of grid electricity procurement.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a business model guideline of electricity utility systems based on blockchain technology in Thailand: a case study of consumers, prosumers and SMEs. Because the resource management of electricity utility systems in Thailand presently are based on enhanced single buyer or a centralized system. However, a free-trade energy market is likely to open or occur in the near future. Thus, a preparation of changing or adapting such a free-trade energy market using disruptive technology is an important point to study the aforementioned disruptive technology (i.e. blockchain technology). The future business of the free-trade energy market is related to the policy of the government (Thailand 4.0). It will support technology development and innovation to encourage the potential and readiness and to compete for foreign countries. In this scoping study, the business model guideline of electricity trading with peer to peer (P2P) is proposed to utilize the case study of consumers and prosumers/SMEs in Thailand based on a decentralized system. The P2P trading is directly the buying and selling of electricity between both consumers and prosumers. It is not a passed intermediary; otherwise, an intermediate process can be cut by this trading in order to save and reduce electricity costs. Preliminary expected impacts of cost structure analysis are summarized in terms of comparisons between the existing electricity trading and the blockchain technology. The results of such preliminary expected impacts show that costs to consumers, prosumers and SMEs obtained from the use of blockchain technology are possibly lower than those of EGAT, PEA, and MEA in the future. In addition, the business model guideline is completely discussed by theory in disruptive innovation.},

The transformation process is characterised by the interplay of old and new technologies from the energy sector as well as structural coupling with other sectors, such as the information and communications technology (ICT), enabling the technology transfer as well as market entry by information technology (IT) actors. Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach to the current organisation form of the energy market. This paper discusses the applicability and prospects for blockchain-based technologies in the energy sector, which are described using the term “blockchain energy”. For the purposes of this study, blockchain energy encompasses all socio-technical and organisational conﬁgurations in the energy sector based on the utilisation of the blockchain principle for energy trading, information storage, and/or increased transparency of energy ﬂows and energy services. In the following chapters, the authors present and discuss the current transformation in the electricity market, followed by a review of the different utilisation possibilities for blockchain technologies in the energy sector and a discussion of the barriers and potential for blockchain energy using a transition studies perspective.

	abstract = {The unpredictability and intermittency introduced by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in power systems may lead to unforeseen peaks of energy production, which might differ from energy demand. To manage these mismatches, a proper communication between prosumers (i.e., users with RESs that can either inject or absorb energy) and active users (i.e., users that agree to have their loads changed according to the system needs) is required. To achieve this goal, the centralized approach used in traditional power systems is no longer possible because both prosumers and active users would like to take part in energy transactions, and a decentralized approach based on transactive energy systems (TESs) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy transactions should be adopted. In this context, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), based on the blockchain concept arises as the most promising solution to enable smart contracts between prosumers and active users, which are safely guarded in blocks with cryptographic hashes. The aim of this paper is to provide a review about the deployment of decentralized TESs and to propose and discuss a transactive management infrastructure. In this context, the concept of Proof of Energy is proposed as a novel consensus protocol for P2P energy exchanges managed by DLT. An application of the proposed infrastructure considering a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) aggregator and residential prosumers endowed with a new transactive controller to manage the electrical storage system is discussed.},

	abstract = {Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.},

	abstract = {The adoption of blockchain technology is emerging as a promising approach in managing decentralized local energy markets (LEM). In this study we analyze the issues related to the deployment of a blockchain-based LEM on devices as much as possible similar to modern smart meters. The presented LEM is based on an automated market-making mechanism. Buying and selling prices are dynamically determined by the amount of energy consumed and produced within a local energy community. We implemented the market in a blockchain application based on the Cosmos framework, which was deployed on embedded devices in a test pilot consisting of 18 residential buildings in Southern Switzerland. The sustainability of the application was investigated by analyzing the resources required by the blockchain to operate. The obtained results show how the developed application uses a small part of the resources of the embedded devices, approximately 100 MB for the memory usage and about 4\% as regards the CPU. Thus, while the application deployment on smart meters is still troublesome, especially for memory requirements, the deployment at the data concentrator level is reasonable and feasible. Finally, we propose possible improvements and extensions that can be implemented in future versions of the presented solution.},

	abstract = {Deployment of distributed generation technologies, especially solar photovoltaic, have turned regular consumers into active contributors to the local supply of electricity. This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the speciﬁc rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As diﬀerent local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system conﬁgurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and ﬂexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31\% for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery’s ﬂexibility in balancing supplydemand operations.},

This study develops and evaluates a generalizable method for managing energy trading between microgrids in a grid-connected network through multi-agent techniques. The approach is demonstrated for a 3node network and a 9-node network for a simulated year with hourly load and solar data for each unique microgrid agent. Results are compared against baseline networks without trading enabled to quantify a 3.6\% and 5.4\% reduction in the levelized cost of energy, respectively, with trading enabled for the 3-node and 9-node cases. Local energy storage capacities are varied to examine impact on the levelized cost of energy and trading behaviors. Results indicate that trading between microgrids reduces the levelized cost of energy for each individual node and the whole network, and that certain trends emerge between agents that allow some microgrids to operate at a lower cost than others.},

The export tariffs at which these sell-backs take place are considerably lower than the feed-in tariffs, offering little incentive to prosumers to sell their surplus energy. A peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity market where consumers and prosumers can interact by selling and buying energy between them at a premium rate that is lower than the standard feed-in tariffs but higher than the export tariffs is proposed. Such a system was modelled to process transactions every 20 s, and a simulation tool was created to obtain the total daily money flows between a consumer-prosumer pair. The inclusion of a Distributed Storage System (DSS) is also considered in the modelled system and simulation. The simulation results showed that the inclusion of a DSS is always beneficial for all parties in economic terms: consumers could save up to 6.4 \% on the cost of their electricity while prosumers could save up to 49.1 \%. A DSS could generate an income flow for the DNO of up to 6.9p/day per each consumer-prosumer pair.},

Community‐based and neighborhood energy projects, where consumers and prosumers of electricity trade their energy locally in a peer‐to‐peer system, have started to emerge in different parts of the world. This study investigates and compares the costs incurred by individual households and households organized in electricity trading communities in seeking to attain greater independence from the centralized electricity system. This independence is investigated with respect to: (i) the potential to reduce the electricity transfer capacity to and from the centralized system and (ii) the potential to increase self‐sufficiency. An optimization model is designed to analyze the investment and operation of residential photovoltaic battery systems. The model is then applied to different cases in a region of southern Sweden for year 2030. Utilizing measured electricity demand data for Swedish households, we show that with a reduced electricity transfer capacity to the centralized system, already a community of five residential prosumers can supply the household demand at lower cost than can prosumers acting individually. Grouping of residential prosumers in an electricity trading community confers greater benefits under conditions with a reduced electricity transfer capacity than when the goal is to become electricity self‐sufficient. It is important to consider the local utilization of photovoltaicgenerated electricity and its effect on the net trading pattern (to and from the centralized system) when discussing the impact on the electricity system of a high percentage of prosumers.},

Impacts of different bidding strategies, including game theoretic approaches, on the economic efficiencies of the P2P transactive energy market are also studied.

	abstract = {This paper presents an automated peer-to-peer negotiation strategy for settling energy contracts among prosumers in a Residential Energy Cooperative considering heterogeneity prosumer preferences. The heterogeneity arises from prosumers’ evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and environmental criteria and the prosumers’ private preferences over those criteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually agree on periodical energy contracts/loans consisting of the energy volume to be exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The negotiating prosumers navigate through a common negotiation domain consisting of potential energy contracts and evaluate those contracts from their valuations on the entailed criteria against a utility function that is robust against generation and demand uncertainty. From the repeated interactions, a prosumer gradually learns about the compatibility of its peers in reaching energy contracts that are closer to Nash solutions. Empirical evaluation on real demand, generation and storage profiles – in multiple system scales – illustrates that the proposed negotiation based strategy can increase the system efficiency (measured by utilitarian social welfare) and fairness (measured by Nash social welfare) over a baseline strategy and an individual flexibility control strategy representing the status quo strategy. We thus elicit system benefits from peer-to-peer flexibility exchange already without any central coordination and market operator, providing a simple yet flexible and effective paradigm that complements existing markets.},

In the P2P markets, players can directly negotiate under bilateral energy trading to match demand and supply. The trading scheme should be designed adequately to incentivise players to participate in the trading process actively. This article proposes a decentralized P2P energy trading scheme for electricity markets with high penetration of DERs. A novel algorithm using primal-dual gradient method is described to clear the market in a fully decentralized manner without interaction of any central entity. Also, to incorporate technical constraints in the energy trading, line ﬂow constraints are modeled in the bilateral energy trading to avoid overloaded or congested lines in the system. This market structure respects market players’ preferences by allowing bilateral energy trading with product differentiation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulation studies, and it is found that market players can trade energy to maximize their welfare without violating line ﬂow constraints. Also, compared with other similar methods for P2P trading, the proposed approach needs lower data exchange and has a faster convergence.},

TESS thereby opens up current integrated closed-system TS, allows for the better adaptation of TS to power systems with high shares of renewable energies, and lays the foundations for a smart grid with a variety of stakeholders. Furthermore, despite positive experiences in various pilot projects, one hurdle in introducing TS is their integration with existing tariff structures and (legal) requirements. In this paper, we therefore describe TESS as we have modiﬁed it for a ﬁeld implementation within the service territory of Holy Cross Energy in Colorado. Importantly, our speciﬁcation addresses challenges of implementing TS in existing electric retail systems, for instance, the design of bidding strategies when a (non-transactive) tariff system is already in place. We conclude with a general discussion of the challenges associated with “brownﬁeld” implementation of TS, such as incentive problems of baseline approaches or long-term efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {The emergence of peer-to-peer, collective or community self-consumption, and transactive energy concepts gives rise to new configurations of business models for local energy trading among a variety of actors. Much attention has been paid in the academic literature to the transition of the underlying energy system with its macroeconomic market framework. However, fewer contributions focus on the microeconomic aspects of the broad set of involved actors. Even though specific case studies highlight single business models, a comprehensive analysis of emerging business models for the entire set of actors is missing. Following this research gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of 135 peer-reviewed journal articles to examine business models of actors operating in local energy markets. From 221 businesses in the reviewed literature, nine macro-actor categories are identified. For each type of market actor, a business model archetype is determined and characterised using the business model canvas. The key elements of each business model archetype are discussed, and areas are highlighted where further research is needed. Finally, this paper outlines the differences of business models for their presence in the three local energy market models. Focusing on the identified customers and partner relationships, this study highlights the key actors per market model and the character of the interactions between market participants.},

The paper provides LOB market rules, clearing algorithm, and illustrative examples and discusses clearing algorithm performance and reliability. The proposed LOB design includes support for discovering prices arising from wholesale electricity markets, distribution system asset constraints, distributed energy resource constraints, and consumer willingness to consume or produce at a reservation price.},

	abstract = {Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to excess value captured by miners (or validators) from users in a cryptocurrency network. This excess value often comes from reordering users' transactions to maximize fees or from inserting new transactions that front-run users' transactions. One of the most common types of MEV involves a `sandwich attack' against a user trading on a constant function market maker (CFMM), which is a popular class of automated market maker. We analyze game theoretic properties of MEV in CFMMs that we call {\textbackslash}textit\{routing\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{reordering\} MEV. In the case of routing, we present examples where the existence of MEV both degrades and, counterintuitively, {\textbackslash}emph\{improves\} the quality of routing. We construct an analogue of the price of anarchy for this setting and demonstrate that if the impact of a sandwich attack is localized in a suitable sense, then the price of anarchy is constant. In the case of reordering, we show conditions when the maximum price impact caused by the reordering of sandwich attacks in a sequence of trades, relative to the average price, impact is \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ in the number of user trades. Combined, our results suggest methods that both MEV searchers and CFMM designers can utilize for estimating costs and profits of MEV.},

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels, are growing rapidly and reshaping power systems. To promote DERs, utility companies usually adopt feed-in-tariff (FIT) to pay DER owners (aka prosumers) ﬁxed rates for supplying energy to the grid. As an alternative to FIT, consumers and prosumers can trade energy in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. In this paper, we focus on a P2P market using double auctions, in which the payoffs of energy consumers/prosumers are determined by their bids and auction mechanisms. Special features of a P2P energy auction, however, including zero marginal cost and publicly-known reserve prices, may invalidate many theories on auction design and hinder market development. We discuss the impacts of such features on four speciﬁc clearing mechanisms: k-double, Vickrey, McAfee and maximum volume matching (MVM). Furthermore, we propose an automated bidding framework based on multi-agent, multi-armed bandit learning, in which each agent only needs to utilize their own bidding history to determine how to bid in the next round through certain regret-minimizing algorithms. Numerical results show that the k-double and McAfee auction appear to perform better in terms of bidders’ surplus. However, if the auctioneer also requires compensation, MVM can yield the most proﬁt for the auctioneer.},

	abstract = {In the emerging realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), most of the existing Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocols used by major platforms like Uniswap and Curve are governed by a static mathematical equation, such as the constant product curve. One major shortcoming of these curves is that they require external forces to maintain the price of the liquidity pool (LP), subjecting the LP to loss due to arbitrage. A novel solution, the dynamic curve AMM, was recently proposed to ensure that the pool price always matches the market price, making the LP invulnerable to arbitrageurs. Dynamic curves, however, have a path-dependent trading problem, meaning that the number of trades and the distribution of trades affect the trader’s gain. We show how to find the optimal trading policy for a dynamic AMM curve under several settings. We first show that in a zero-transaction-fee setting the optimal trading policy is to place infinitesimally small trades, resulting in zero slippage. Then, we present an algorithm that computes the optimal policy in a fixed-number-of-trade setting. Though the problem has an exponentially large search space, our algorithm utilizes dynamic programming to achieve a polynomial run-time. Finally, we generalize the solution to more complex settings, including a per-order-fee setting and a percentage-fee setting.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a mechanism design for energy trading in energy communities. Each community member is modeled as a strategic agent making strategic actions in interaction with other agents. The proposed mechanism includes two stages, in which in the first stage agents iteratively bid in a day-ahead market, and schedule their energy profiles for the whole operation horizon. Then, in the second stage, agents participate in a one-shot auction for energy trading in each time slot. The two-stage design allows agents to reduce their energy costs by having access to better prices in ahead markets, and also, by granting agents the ability to adjust their bids near real-time, based on their updated demand/generation profile. It is shown that, under mild assumptions on bidding of agents in stage two, the proposed mechanism is Bayes–Nash incentive compatible. Moreover, it is proven that the mechanism is ex-post budget balanced, and individually rational. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can reduce the energy costs of the community and helps to reduce the reliance of the community on upstream networks.},

This is obtained without necessarily installing electric storage or exploiting tax funded incentives. The beneﬁts of aggregating the electric demand and renewable output of multiple households are known and established; in fact, regulations and pilot energy communities are being implemented worldwide. Financing and managing a shared urban PV system remains an unsolved issue, even when the proﬁtability of the system as a whole is demonstrable. For this reason, an agent-based modelling environment has been developed and is presented in this study. It is assumed that an optimal system (optimized for self-sufﬁciency) is shared between 48 households in a local grid of a positive energy district. Different scenarios are explored and discussed, each varying in number of owners (agents who own a PV system) and their pricing behaviour. It has been found that a smaller number of investors (i.e., someone refuse to join) provokes an increase of the earnings for the remaining investors (from 8 to 74\% of the baseline). Furthermore, the pricing strategy of an agent shows improvement potential without knowledge of the demand of others, and thus it has no privacy violations.},

	abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a ﬂexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the ﬁeld of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efﬁcient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classiﬁcation of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of speciﬁcally using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited ﬁeld of research, quite different applications are identiﬁed with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver speciﬁc insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

Blockchain also improves the security of the platform because all the involved actors can be certain about the authorship of the information produced in the system.

Recent advances in analytical and computational tools are permitting new approaches to the quantitative study of these aspects. One such approach is Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE), the computational study of economic processes modeled as dynamic systems of interacting agents. This chapter explores the potential advantages and disadvantages of ACE for the study of economic systems. General points are concretely illustrated using an ACE model of a two-sector decentralized market economy. Six issues are highlighted: Constructive understanding of production, pricing, and trade processes; the essential primacy of survival; strategic rivalry and market power; behavioral uncertainty and learning; the role of conventions and organizations; and the complex interactions among structural attributes, institutional arrangements, and behavioral dispositions.},

Recently, under the paradigm of Agent-based computational economics (ACE) a new research focus is forming and a large number of literatures are springing up, but there is still no the discussion on ACE’s theoretical value and insufficiency in the research of electricity market in the hierarchy of methodology, therefore the author’s research is an attempt in this aspect. By means of analyzing the evolution of economics methodology from mathematical deduction to simulation induction and their inherent relevance, the unique superiority of ACE on the level of methodology is expounded. The further selective survey on existing literatures shows that with the ACE model the marketization process can be understood clearly in deeper level and wider scope. Finally to give a reference to theoretical progress, the prospect application of ACE, especially its potential in China’s electric sector restructuring is discussed.},

	abstract = {The transfer of market power in electric generation from utilities to end-users spurred by the diﬀusion of distributed energy resources necessitates a new system of settlement in the electricity business that can better manage generation assets at the grid-edge. A new concept in facilitating distributed generation is peer-to-peer energy trading, where households exchange excess power with neighbors at a price they set themselves. However, little is known about the eﬀects of peer-to-peer energy trading on the sociotechnical dynamics of electric power systems. Further, given the novelty of the concept, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of alternative electricity market structures and individual decision strategies on neighborhood exchanges and market outcomes. This study develops an empirical agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate peer-to-peer electricity trades in a decentralized residential energy market. The framework is applied for a case study in Perth, Western Australia, where a blockchain-enabled energy trading platform was trialed among 18 households, which acted as prosumers or consumers. The ABM is applied for a set of alternative electricity market structures. Results assess the impact of solar generation forecasting approaches, battery energy storage, and ratio of prosumers to consumers on the dynamics of peer-to-peer energy trading systems. Designing an eﬃcient, equitable, and sustainable future energy system hinges on the recognition of trade-oﬀs on and across, social, technological, economic, and environmental levels. Results demonstrate that the ABM can be applied to manage emerging uncertainties by facilitating the testing and development of management strategies.},

	abstract = {The desire of prosumers to participate in the markets has led to the setting up of Decentralized Local Electricity Markets (DLEM). These markets are usually confined to a small geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Such markets have very low liquidity for participants to trade, so price discovery becomes a cumbersome process. To solve the issue of market liquidity, this paper introduces a DLEM model where market participants can trade with a Liquidity Pool (LP) created by Energy Storage Units (ESU). The market model provides iteration-free price discovery by using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol, which automatically updates energy price in the LP based on demand–supply balance. The efficiency of AMM is further improved using the concept of concentrated liquidity by restricting the trading range. A network loss compensation method is applied to ensure DLEM transactions do not affect the power contracts already committed. Simulation studies are conducted on IEEE 33 bus and 123 bus distribution networks for various energy demand scenarios to show operation of the proposed market model.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, which allows energy consumers/producers to directly trade with each other, is one of the new paradigms driven by the decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization of the energy supply chain. Additionally, the rise of blockchain technology suggests unprecedented socio-economic benefits for energy systems, especially when coupled with P2P energy trading. Despite such future prospects in energy systems, three key challenges might hinder the full integration of P2P energy trading and blockchain. First, it is quite complicated to design a decentralized P2P market that keeps a fair balance between economic efficiency and information privacy. Secondly, with the proliferation of storage devices, new P2P market designs are needed to account for their inter-temporal dependencies. Thirdly, a practical implementation of blockchain technology for P2P trading is required, which can facilitate efficient trading in a secured and fraud-resilient way, while eliminating any intermediaries’ costs. In this paper, we develop a new decentralized P2P energy trading platform to address all the aforementioned challenges. Our platform consists of two key layers: market and blockchain. The market layer features a parallel and short-term pool-structured auction and is cleared using a novel decentralized Ant-Colony Optimization method. This market arrangement guarantees a nearoptimally efficient market solution, preserves players’ privacy, and allows inter-temporal market products trading. The blockchain layer offers a high level of automation, security, and fast real-time settlements through smart contract implementation. Finally, using real-world data, we simulate the functionality of the platform regarding energy trading, market clearing, smart contract operations, and blockchain-based settlements.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general automated market maker (AMM) framework describing the economics and formalizing the system's state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top automated market maker (AMM) protocols' mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs)' inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both decentralized finance (DeFi) and conventional market microstructure.},

Formerly centralized energy systems need to be adapted to take full advantage of the immense potential of decentralized energy generation and smart, interconnected energy end users. We introduce a local electricity market on which prosumers and consumers of a community are able to trade electricity directly amongst each other. This local electricity market supports the local integration of renewable energy generation. It facilitates a local balance of energy supply and demand and hence reduces the need for extensive electricity transmission. We introduce, evaluate and compare two local market designs, a direct peer-to-peer market and a closed order book market, as well as two agent behaviors, zero-intelligence agents and intelligently bidding agents. We derive four scenarios by combining each market design with each agent behavior, respectively. All market scenarios offer similar economic advantages for the market participants. However, the peer-to-peer market with intelligent agents appears to be the most advantageous as it results in the lowest average overall electricity price.},

Decentralized generation by residential solar photovoltaic cells creates the potential for peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading, where households can act as consumers and prosumers to buy and sell renewable electricity. P2P energy markets are emerging at locations across the globe, and market performance is affected by various social, economic, and environmental factors. This research applies an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate electricity trades between heterogeneous households in a decentralized market. The P2P system is tested for 15 locations in the United States that vary in climate parameters and local economic factors. The results from these simulations are compared to assess how differences in climate, demand pattern, retail rate, and irradiance affect market performance. Simulations demonstrate that market outcomes rely on the ratio of prosumers to consumers, environmental factors, and geographic conditions. Battery energy storage overcomes limitations associated with faulty forecasting and improves the flexibility of household-generated solar resources to increase the proportion of production that is sold in the P2P market. The application of the agent-based modeling framework demonstrates how P2P markets can be expected to perform for various locations and can be applied to assess alternative locations for market performance.},
