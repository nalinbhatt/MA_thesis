## Relationship to Final Implementation

### Evolution to Final Code

The development process moved from notebooks to structured Python modules:

1. **Notebook Prototyping**: Initial algorithm development in interactive environment
2. **Code Extraction**: Moving working code to separate Python files
3. **Modularization**: Organizing code into logical modules (model.py, agents.py, etc.)
4. **Optimization**: Performance improvements and code cleanup
5. **Production**: Final simulation frameworks in ABM Model/ and DA Model/

### Key Insights

The notebook development process contributed several key insights:

- Importance of modular agent design
- Need for comprehensive data tracking
- Value of interactive parameter exploration
- Challenges of battery optimization algorithms

## Preservation Value

### Research Documentation

These notebooks document the research process:

- **Methodology Development**: How analytical approaches were developed
- **Problem Identification**: Issues encountered and solutions found
- **Alternative Paths**: Approaches considered but not pursued
- **Learning Process**: Evolution of understanding throughout research

### Reproducibility

While not part of the final analysis pipeline, these notebooks:

- Show the complete research development process
- Provide context for design decisions in final implementation
- Demonstrate alternative approaches for future research
- Serve as backup implementations for core algorithms

## Future Use

### Extension Research

Future researchers could use these notebooks for:

## Maintenance

### Archive Status

These notebooks are maintained in archive status:

- Code is preserved as-is for historical reference
- No ongoing development or updates
- Dependencies may become outdated over time
- Focus is on preservation rather than functionality

### Access Recommendations

When reviewing these notebooks:

1. **Historical Context**: Remember these represent development phases
2. **Code Quality**: Expect experimental and incomplete implementations
3. **Documentation**: Look for comments explaining development decisions
4. **Evolution**: Compare with final implementations to see research progression

The rough notebooks provide valuable insight into the research development process and serve as an important complement to the final, polished simulation frameworks.
